/**
 * Class Name : PersistenceProvider
 * Diagram    : Expojo Context and Components
 * Project    : ExPOJO Core
 * Type       : abstract
 * Superclass for all persistence providers. This class is extended to provide persistence
 * engine specific implementations. eg., HibernatePersistenceProvider and JdoPersistenceProvider.
 * These objects are typically kept 'open' throughout multiple HTTP requests, for each
 * request a transaction is begun at the start and commited (or rolled back) at the end.
 * This implements the 'OpenSessionInView' (hibernate) or 'OpenPersistenceManagerInView'
 * pattern.
 * A future possible enhancement is to add an optional "free persistence provider' mechanism
 * at the end of each HTTP request.
